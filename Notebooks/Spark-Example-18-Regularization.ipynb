    "| **Coefficient Shrinkage vs. Selection** | - Shrinks all coefficients continuously towards zero. <br> - Does not force any coefficient to be exactly zero, thus retaining all predictors in the model.                                       | - Encourages sparsity by driving some coefficients exactly to zero. <br> - Performs variable selection by effectively eliminating less important predictors from the model.                        |\n",
